# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates will be issued for any branch, tag or version that is ahead of `main` or is `main`. Breanches and tags that are behind `main` will not be updated. Such versions are not used, unless cached and offline; as soon as the client is online again, all resources are updated to match `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities by getting in touch with any active Cloudnode employee, for instance via live chat, ticket or to their @cloudnode.pro e-mail. All reports are forwarded to the Cloudnode administrators team. If you wish to submit a report directly to this team, please send it to `admin@cloudnode.pro`. Before sending your report, please verify that it is valid and conclusive. Do note that further information might be requested in order for us to address the issue; by submitting a security report, you agree to receive communication from us via e-mail. Please also note that submitting false reports is a violation of the general Terms of Service.

Security is of the utmost importance to us and we handle all reports very seriously. Please do understand that we might not be able to respond to your report right away. Once your report reaches our administrators, its severity will be evaluated and our engineers will start implementing a patch as soon as possible.

__Don't__ submit security reports or other sensitive information in public domains, such as GitHub issues and groups! Our team will create a security advisory which will be visible only to Cloudnode administrators and engineers. The advisory will be made public after a final security update is issued and rolled out for all users.
