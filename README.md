# website
This is the front-end of Cloudnode's website. This repository does not include the API or other back-end/server-side integrations. Some front-end pages that are not yet made publicly available may not appear in this repository.

Note: `/js/main.js.php` is a JavaScript file, which, however, has some PHP in it. The file `/css/main.css.php` includes `/css/_main.css` and automatically applies `@media prefers-color-scheme` rules based on files in `/css/themes`; this is done because the dark theme cannot be imported inside a `@media` rule.
